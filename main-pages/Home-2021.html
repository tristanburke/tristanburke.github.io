                        <b>The Classroom, VR Application: </b> My most recent project in VR, The Classroom is an interactive educational experience. I built the application in Unity, and modeled many of the assets myself in Blender. The first . I started by implementing a class in the solar system. The user learns about the planets of our solar system, with the ability to pick up and hold each planet, as well .

                        <b>Huddle, VR Application:</b> A project I devised with my brother during the middle of the pandemic, Huddle is an application allowing users to meet in a virtual business room. Once again, I built the project in Unity and modeled all of the assets in Blender. I utilized Unity's Photon Networking tool to allow multiple users to enter the room. The final prototype allowed users to join a meeting room together, speak to one another, and see each other head and controller movements.

                    <p>
                        I am originally from Summit, New Jersey, but I lived in London from ages 9 to 18. After 
                        graduating high school, I came back across the pond to attend UC Berkeley where I studied
                        Computer Science. In addition to my studies at Berkeley, I tutored piano, was a member of a workshop insitution, and also played piano in a jazz-funk bank called Mint Julep (check out our website!). 
                        <br><br>
                        Since graduating, I have lived in New York City. In my free time I enjoy making music, video games,
                        cooking, and spending time with my two older brothers who also live in the city. As covered by my Projects above,
                        I also enjoy both developing and playing VR applications.
