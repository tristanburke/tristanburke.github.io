                        <b>The Classroom, VR Application: </b> My most recent project in VR, The Classroom is an interactive educational experience. I built the application in Unity, and modeled many of the assets myself in Blender. The first . I started by implementing a class in the solar system. The user learns about the planets of our solar system, with the ability to pick up and hold each planet, as well .

                        <b>Huddle, VR Application:</b> A project a devised with my brother during the middle of the pandemic, Huddle is an application allowing users to meet virtually in a virtual business room. I enable multiplayer with Unity's Photon Networking tool to allow multiple users to enter the room. The final prototype enabled me to "meet" with some of my friends and family virtually in a meeting room. Users could talk to one another and see each other's movements.

                        I was born in Summit, New Jersey, but moved to London at the age of 9, where I
                        went to the American School in London until hopping the pond back to attend UC Berkeley. After 
                        graduating, I moved to NYC where my two older brothers and many friends live. 
                        I enjoy playing music still, playing video games, and cooking!
