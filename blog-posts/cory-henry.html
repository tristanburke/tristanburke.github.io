        <p>I will be the first to admit I have a unhealthy relationship with Youtube. As one of the five sites
            I have bookmarked (Github, FB, Reddit, IsitChristmas), I visit Youtube daily. Although I would argue I
            have learned a lot on Youtube, it has undoubtedly been a black hole of procrastination, perpetrated
            by the astonishingly accurate "Recommended" and "Related Videos" side bar. I often find hours can fly by
            as video after video magically presents itself to me on any given topic, all perfectly titled to perk my interest
            and prolong a quick break into an hour long video watching montage.
            <br><br>
            It was during one of these endless video sessions that I came across a video title
            "Cory Henry visits Casio at NAMM".

            <bold>WARNING:</bold>this post will be chalk full of Youtube links, so unless
            you have the patience to watch them all, nevermind the patience to even finish reading my ceaseless rambling,
            I would recommend waiting to watch some of the better videos down below :)
            <br><br>
            This particular viewing session surrounded the title character of this post, Cory henry. The session was a montage of
            live performances, lessons, interviews, or any of the countless other videos Cory is featured in.
            The reason I am bringing this particular video to note is because I was abnormally suprised upon viewing it
            (I say abnormally because Cory's videos consistently inspire shock).
            To summarize, the video takes place at NAMM Festival(National Association of Music Merchants), an annual
            gathering of musicians, makers, corporations, inventors, and music lovers who come together to both show off
            both instruments and/or their abilities to play them. In fact, Cory Henry is no stranger to these events/festivals
            and there are a handful videos (some linked below) of him shredding the newest music tech for a handful of lucky listeners.
            I'm sure these videos make great marketing campaigns for the instruments touched by Henry, something along the lines of
            "Hey, get the new CASIO and play like this!". Anyways, this video surprised because as Henry casually destroys
            this new instrument, there is no one in sight. Now before you rightfully bring up the point that NAAM festival isn't exactly
            Coachella and it's unlikely Corey was going to be surrounded by an eager crowd, let me say that other reasonably famous musicians have
            frequented these festivals before and still managed to draw crowds, cameras, and fans. Meanwhile, people meander by Cory
            without so much as a glance (aside from one individual who quietly asks a friend, "...is that Cory Henry?"). This brings me to
            the main point of this post: Cory Henry is simply too impressive an artist to go by unnoticed, too impressive to meander by
            without yelling to your friend "HOLY SHIT, CORY HENRY!". So impressive, that even as I rave about him here, I have no doubt
            I could watch a new video of him and still yet think more highly of his playing abilities
            .<br><br> But don't take my word for it. Instead,

            Two things about this one:
            1 – What a sound from that synth. So mean, so unfiltered. It <br>
            2 – The riff at 0:54 haunted my dreams for . <br>
            3 – Actually 3 sorry but that bass hit 0:58 :o (wow) <br>
            4 – Ok actually sorry I can’t help myself. This song seems to be a favorite of the band and is often played at concerts.
            My favorite version however, aside from the one referenced above, is one played and after party. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pva70ehBFA -
            3:21The hilarious cue in before really makes it. Shut the fuck up. God dammit. <br>

            I firstly love how subtlety this cover creeps in (tune comes in around 1:49). As a side note, the Dumbledore looking fellow in the back there is none other than organ legend Dr. Lonnie Smith.
