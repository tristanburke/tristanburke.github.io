        <p>I will be the first to admit I have a unhealthy relationship with Youtube. As one of the four sites
            I have bookmarked (Github, FB, Reddit, IsitChristmas), I visit Youtube daily. Although I would argue I
            have learned a lot on Youtube, it has undoubtedly been a black hole of procrastination, perpetrated
            by the astonishingly accurate "Recommended" and "Related Videos" side bar. I often find hours can fly by
            as video after video magically presents itself to me on any given topic, all perfectly titled to perk my interest
            and prolong a quick break into an hour long video watching montage.

            I would recommend waiting to watch some of the better videos down below :)

            This particular viewing session surrounded the title character of this post, Cory henry. The session was a montage of
            live performances, lessons, interviews, or any of the countless other videos Cory is featured in.
            The reason I am bringing this particular video to note is because I was abnormally suprised upon viewing it
            (I saw abnormally because Cory's videos consistently inspire shock, awe, and all that jazz upon viewing).
            To summarize, the video takes place at NAMM Festival(National Association of Music Merchants), an annual
            gathering of musicians, makers, corporations, inventors, and music lovers who come together to both show off
            their newest . In fact that is exactly the
            Cory Henry is no stranger to these events/festivals and there are a handful videos of
