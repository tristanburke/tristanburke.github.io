                <h3>Coding and Me</h3><br>
                <p>My computer science educationally formally began my senior year of high school, when I took AP CS.
                My first project was a program that automatically improvised baroque-style music. Both the code and produced
                    music were poorly written - but alas, it was a start, and eventually, a project I would revisit. <br><br>

                    What initially drew me to CS was the puzzle like challenges often presented in a given task, and the opportunity
                    to find a logical solution, more often than not, a fairly simple and elegant one.
                    I am an avid rubik's cube fan, owning cubes from 2x2s to 7x7s, and I recently started up lock picking
                    (though I am somewhat hesitant writing this due to the trades nefarious associations). <br><br>

                <p> I would ideally like to combine my technical skills with one of my many other interests; fusing my
                    computer science ability with the passion and dedication I have to the many hobbies and interests in my life, music to name one.
                    However, I would forfeit an opportunity to combine my skills and interests for any mission or company that sets for the change the world
                    in a new and positive manner.
